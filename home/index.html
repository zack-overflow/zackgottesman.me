				<h2>Dartmouth Football</h2>

			<p>
				Since last year, I have served as the sole data scientist for the Ivy League-champion <a href="https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/football" target="_blank">Dartmouth Football</a> team. Dartmouth Football is pioneering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/sports/ivy-league-football-dartmouth.html" target="_blank">cutting-edge techniques</a> to help improve safety in football. I helped head coach Buddy Teevens to investigate safety during highly dangerous kickoff plays, providing the analysis that led to a proposed rule change to kickoffs in the Ivy League.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Traditionally, kickoffs are known as high-risk plays because of the dangerous collisions that occur when players run full-speed across the length of the field. Recently, the Ivy League implemented a rule that allows the team receiving a kickoff to elect a “fair catch,” which enables that team to take the ball at the 25-yard line without returning the ball. My analysis showed that teams which choose to return the ball on average fail to reach the 25-yard line , suggesting that the statistically smartest strategy is to fair catch all kickoffs. Dartmouth employed this strategy last season, electing to return only three kickoffs over the course of the season. Yet, the data showed that players were still injured from blocking on the fair-catch plays even though the plays were essentially meaningless. Supported by my analysis, Coach Teevens proposed that a new rule allowing teams to announce an intention to fair catch before the kickoff even occurs, preventing injuries and achieving the same result.

			<p>The summer after my freshman year at Dartmouth, I had the pleasure of joining the team at <a href="https://likewise.com" target="_blank">Likewise</a> as a software engineering intern, with a particular focus on machine learning (ML). Likewise is an early-stage recommendation startup, funded by Bill Gates, that provides personalized recommendations for users. Think Yelp combined with Instagram or Facebook. During my internship, I put various ML algorithms into production and gained invaluable experience deploying and documenting ML models. I combined k-prototypes clustering and classification to create a predictive recommender system and improve recommendations for new users. I identified a few distinct groups within the user base that helped the leadership team think about how to approach marketing and new customer acquisition.I then built an end-to-end classification system to predict user retention. I presented this model to members of the product and engineering teams to suggest how we might improve the onboarding process to help retain more users and reduce churn.</p>

			</div>
			<img src="images/corisk.png" align="left"/>
			<p>
				As a final project for Dartmouth <a href="http://cs52.me/">CS52: Full-Stack Web Development</a> in the spring of 2020, I founded <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-greentraceGreenTrace" target="_blank">GreenTrace</a>, now known as CoRisk, an application to help Dartmouth students return safely to campus during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. After adding a few brilliant teammates, we engineered a mobile application in React Native that featured contact tracing (alerting users if they had come into contact with a COVID-positive individual), pertinent contact information of campus health services, and an anonymized heat map of cases so students knew which areas of campus to avoid. The full list of features can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-greentrace#feature-overview" target="_blank">Github</a>. Apart from my role as the founder/inventor of GreenTrace, I also worked on backend development for the app, setting up anonymous accounts and authentication using a randomized two-word token for each user and writing the contact-tracing algorithm. Working on the project helped me become more familiar with NodeJS and NoSQL databases (we used MongoDB).
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The project was a success, and, after the spring term came to a close, Dartmouth approached our team about continuing to develop GreenTrace for use on campus. We partnered with Dartmouth's <a href="http://dali.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">DALI Lab</a> to transform the project into CoRisk, an application that provides information for Dartmouth students to help reduce COVID-19 transmission. CoRisk is currently in development, with an anticipated release this winter.

			<img src="images/seattleusimple.png" align="left"/>
			<p>
				For the past three years, I have been working on economics research with health economics professor Erin Vernon of Seattle University. Initially, we intended to use <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="
				">Google Trends</a> to explore how searches about mental health have varied over time, but in the course of our research, we noticed a number of prior publications using Google Trends to assess the efficacy of disease awareness days. We were curious if the established literature in fact tied increased search activity to measurable health benefits for those afflicted by diseases. We performed a systematic review of the awareness event literature to assess if the existing research provided any clues about how awareness days, weeks, and months produce concrete benefits for patients.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				In 2019, we presented our findings at the <a href="https://weai.org/conferences/view/2/94th-Annual-Conference" target="_blank">94th annual conference of the Western Economic Association</a> in San Francisco. The manuscript is now in the final stages of revision for acceptance to the journal <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine" target="_blank">Social Science & Medicine</a>.

				<h2>Hillary for America</h2>
			</div>
			<img src="images/hfalogo.jpg" align="left"/>
			<p>
				In the summer and fall of 2016, I worked as a finance intern for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. I started my internship early in the summer and almost immediately had more responsibility than I ever imagined I would as a wide-eyed sixteen year old working my first real job. On top of making hours of calls to potential donors every day, I was in charge of organizing and running key events in Seattle for President Bill Clinton and Hillary's vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I learned a lot from the experience, not only from handling these responsibilities, but also from the outcome of the election. Before the election, I was living in my own echo chamber. I read The New York Times in a coffee shop kitty-corner to our Seattle campaign center. The travails of candidate Trump, highlighted in the <i>Times</i>, provided us punchlines and more security on top of the favorable lopsided polls. The attendees at the events I organized reinforced the perception that we were part of a movement and most of the hundreds of people I called told me they were behind us. But clearly many others weren’t. Because of that summer, I now seek conversation with those who disagree with me, hoping to understand different perspectives and other people’s truths.

				<h2>Aldarra Golf Club</h2>
			</div>
			<img src="images/Aldarra_Logo.png" align="left"/>
			<p>
				Golf is one of my lifelong passions. I learned the game from my grandparents and have loved the way it constantly challenges me, allows me to get outdoors, and enables me to spend time with friends and family. In high school, I competed on the varsity golf team, serving as captain from 2017-2018 and finishing in the top 25 in Washington State both years.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				In addition to conducting economics research during the summer before I left for Dartmouth, I served as a caddie at Aldarra Golf Club, one of the top-ranked courses in Washington. Working as a caddie taught me a number of life skills, from the value of punctuality to the ability to appear confident even under uncertainty.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				At Dartmouth, I have continued to pursue my interest in golf through the Club Golf team, the highest level of golf at Dartmouth. This year, I am serving as the club's President and look forward to navigating our team through uncertain times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
