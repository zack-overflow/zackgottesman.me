				<h2>Dartmouth Football</h2>

			<p>
				Since last year, I have served as the sole data scientist for the Ivy League-champion <a href="https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/football" target="_blank">Dartmouth Football</a> team. Dartmouth Football is pioneering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/sports/ivy-league-football-dartmouth.html" target="_blank">cutting edge techniques</a> to help improve safety in football. I helped head coach Buddy Teevens investigate safety during highly dangerous kickoff plays, providing the analysis that backed a proposed rule change to kickoffs in the Ivy League.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Traditionally, kickoffs are known as high-risk plays due to the dangerous collisions that occur when players run full-speed down the field. Recently, the Ivy League implemented a rule that allows the team receiving a kickoff to elect a “fair catch” that allows them to the ball at the 25-yard line. Many teams still choose to return, however, leading to injuries. My analysis showed that, returns actually produce lower rates of success than fair catches, suggesting that a viable strategy would be for teams to intend to fair catch before the kickoff even occurs. Dartmouth employed a very similar strategy last season, electing to return only three kickoffs over the course of the season. Yet, players were still injured from blocking on the fair catch plays although the plays were essentially meaningless. Therefore, backed by my analysis, Coach Teevens proposed that a new rule allow teams to announce an intention to fair catch before the kickoff even occurs and simply take possession at the 25-yard line, preventing injuries and achieving the same result.

			<p>The summer after my freshman year at Dartmouth, I had the pleasure of joining the team at <a href="https://likewise.com" target="_blank">Likewise</a> as a software engineer intern focusing on machine learning. Likewise is an early-stage recommendation startup, funded by Bill Gates, that provides personalized recommendations for users. Think Yelp combined with Instagram or Facebook. During my internship, I put various machine learning algorithms into production and gained invaluable experience deploying and documenting ML models. First, I combined k-prototypes clustering and classification to create predictive recommender system and improve recommendations for new users. I identified a few distinct groups within the user base that helped the leadership team think about how to approach marketing and customer acquistion. Then, I built an end-to-end classification system to predict retention based on limited features. I presented this to members of the product and engineering teams to suggest how we might improve the onboarding process to help retain more users and reduce churn.</p>

				As a final project for Dartmouth CS52: Full-Stack Web Development in the spring of 2020, I founded <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-greentraceGreenTrace" target="_blank">GreenTrace</a>, an application to help Dartmouth students return safely to campus despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. After adding a few brilliant teammates, we engineered a mobile application in React Native that featured contact tracing (alerting users at the end of the day if they had come in contact with a COVID-positive person during the day), pertinent contact information of campus health services, and an anonymized heat map of cases so students knew which areas to avoid. The full list of features can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-greentrace#feature-overview" target="_blank">Github</a>. Apart from my role as the founder/inventor of GreenTrace, I also worked on backend development for the app, setting up anonymous accounts and authentication using a randomized two-word token for each user and writing the contact-tracing algorithm. Working on the project helped me become more familiar with NodeJS and NoSQL databases (we used MongoDB).
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The project was a success, and after the spring term came to a close, Dartmouth approached our team about continuing to develop GreenTrace for use on campus. We partnered with Dartmouth's <a href="http://dali.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">DALI Lab</a> to transform the project into CoRisk, an application that provides information for Dartmouth students to help limit the risk of contracting COVID-19 for themselves and others. CoRisk is currently in development, with an anticipated release this winter.

			<p>
				For the past three years, I have been working on academic economics research alongside health economics professor Erin Vernon of Seattle University. Initially, we intended to use <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="
				">Google Trends</a> to explore how searches about mental health have varied over time, but in the course of our research we noticed a number of prior publications using Trends to assess the efficacy of disease awareness days. We were curious if the established literature indeed tied increased search activity to measurable health benefits for those afflicted by diseases, and therefore performed a systematic review of the awareness event literature to assess if the existing research provided any clues about how awareness days, weeks, and months produce concrete benefits for patients.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				In 2019, we presented our findings at the <a href="https://weai.org/conferences/view/2/94th-Annual-Conference" target="_blank">94th annual conference of the Western Economic Association</a> in San Francisco, CA, and the manuscript is now in the final stages of revision for acceptance to <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine" target="_blank">Social Science & Medicine</a>.

				Golf has been one of my lifelong passions. I learned the game from my grandparents and have loved the way it challenges me, allows me to get outside, and allows me to spend times with friends and family. In high school, I competed on the varsity golf team, serving as a captain from 2017-2018 and finishing in the top 25 in Washington State both years.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Alongisde my economics research during my last few years of high school, I also worked as a caddie at Aldarra Golf Club, one of the top-ranked courses in Washington State. Working as a caddie taught me a number of life skills, from the value of punctuality to the ability to appear confident even under uncertainty.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				At Dartmouth, I have continued to pursue my interest in golf through the Club Golf team, the highest level of golf at Dartmouth. This year, I am serving as the club's President and look forward to navigating our team through these uncertain times.
